# Connect Four

## Description:
This is a quick project based on the game connect four. Players place pieces 'X' and 'O' in alternating order to connect four of the same piece in a row.

## How to use:
When prompted, enter into the terminal which column you want to place your piece in as an _**integer**_.
If your placement was valid, let the other play take their turn (if playing with someone else).

## Functionality:
The game uses lists as a data structure in order to keep track of the pieces. Various functions
change the values in these lists.
